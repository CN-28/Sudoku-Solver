# Sudoku-Solver-with-GUI
Sudoku Solver with very simple GUI.
GUI is coded with Tkinter. App uses backtracking to solve sudoku.

Fill board with valid starter numbers and click "SOLVE" to get a result.
In future I am going to change this project a bit into app solving sudoku from vision using OpenCV library in Python.
