# Sudoku-Solver-with-GUI

Sudoku Solver with a very simple GUI.

GUI is coded with Tkinter. App uses backtracking to solve a sudoku.

Fill board with numbers and click "SOLVE" button to get a result.

To clear the whole board of sudoku click "RESET" button.

In the future I am going to improve this project by adding an option to solve a sudoku 
from the photo using OpenCV library in Python and making better looking and more sophisticated GUI.
