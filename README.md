# Sudoku-Solver-with-GUI

Sudoku Solver with a very simple GUI.

GUI is coded with Tkinter. App uses recursive algorithm with backtracking to solve Sudoku.

Fill board with numbers and click a "SOLVE" button to get the result.

To clear the whole board of Sudoku click a "RESET" button.

In the future I am going to improve this project by adding an option to solve Sudoku 
from the photo using OpenCV library in Python and making a better looking and more sophisticated GUI.
