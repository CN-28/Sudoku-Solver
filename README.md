# Sudoku-Solver-with-GUI

Sudoku Solver with very simple GUI.

GUI is coded with Tkinter. App uses backtracking to solve sudoku.

Fill board with valid starter numbers and click "SOLVE" to get a result.

In future I am going to improve this project by:
  -adding option to solve sudoku from photo using OpenCV library in Python
  -making better looking and more sophisticated GUI
